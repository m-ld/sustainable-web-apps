# specification

This folder contains a draft specification for Sustainable Web Apps, including defining a "sustainable app"; requirements with motivating use-cases; the technical approach taken, including justification of the project hypothesis; and abstract interface descriptions for application developers and framework developers.

The contents of this folder are intentionally structured as sub-folders and files, amenable to individual review, forming the sections of a coherent specification document.

> Towards the end of the project, we'll publish the final contents of the specification on the web as a single document.
