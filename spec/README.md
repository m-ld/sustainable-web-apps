# specification

This folder contains both a narrative description of the Sustainable Web Apps project, and a formal specification. Both purposes are served by an overlapping set of markdown files.

- The project description can be viewed as plain markdown files beginning here ðŸ‘‰ [Contents and Introduction](index.md)
- The specification can be viewed by launching `index.html` in a suitable container, e.g. using `npx http-server` in this folder; or online at https://sweap.m-ld.org/.

Included in the specification are a definition a "sustainable app"; requirements with motivating use-cases; and a reference architecture.

The project description contains the same information, plus motivation for the technical approach taken, including justification of the project hypothesis; and abstract interface descriptions for application developers and framework developers.

Bibliographical references (as `[[REF]]` in the markdown) can be found in `biblio.json`.
