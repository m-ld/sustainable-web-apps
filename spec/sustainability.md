# sustainability

Our goal is to encourage and support the development of **Sustainable Web Apps**.

For an app to be 'sustainable' we mean that on the one hand, it avoids **unhealthy trends** in the app development industry. It demonstrates:

- No lock-in
- No attention theft
- Retention of control over personal data

On the other hand, it does follow **healthy trends** which help users, and are coming to be expected:

- Live collaboration
- Linking of data between applications
- Robust security

We have arrived at these principles from analysis of the [use-cases](use-cases.md) (and, if we're honest, from the [prior art](design/prior-art.md) that has inspired us).

## no lock-in

No lock-in means that users are not tied to a specific platform or ecosystem, choosing the tools that best fit their needs and being independent of any single provider. They have the freedom and autonomy to take _their data_ to alternative solutions without losing anything. Sustainable apps are built in such a way as to make this the _normal_ behaviour.

## no attention theft

Attention theft refers to the unethical practice of design elements or features that manipulate users' attention, leading to excessive distractions or addictive behaviors. A sustainable web app avoids attention theft by prioritizing user focus and minimizing unnecessary notifications or disruptive elements, allowing users to concentrate.

## retention of control

Sustainable web apps prioritize user control and data ownership. Users have the authority to decide how their personal data is stored, accessed, and shared. This ensures compliance with privacy regulations, empowers users to manage their information securely, and reduces the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

## live collaboration

Real-time collaboration among team members, researchers, or collaborators, facilitates seamless communication, immediate feedback, and efficient teamwork. Sustainable web apps offer features such as real-time editing, commenting, and document sharing, ensuring that users can collaborate effectively and enhance productivity.

## linking of data

The ability to link data between applications is crucial for seamless integration and data interoperability. Sustainable web apps support data linking, enabling users to connect relevant fine-grained information, references, or resources across different contexts or tools. This facilitates comprehensive data analysis, knowledge discovery, and a holistic understanding of projects or research endeavors.

## robust security

Sustainable web apps implement stringent security measures, including data encryption, access controls, and regular security updates. This ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of users' data, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access or data loss.
