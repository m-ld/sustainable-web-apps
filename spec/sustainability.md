# Desirable Properties for Web Apps

**Unhealthy trends** have arisen in the web app development industry, to be avoided. Apps should demonstrate:

- [=No lock-in=]
- [=No attention theft=]
- [=Retention of control=] over personal data

On the other hand, **healthy trends** have also arisen, which help users, and are coming to be expected:

- [=Live collaboration=]
- [=Linking of data=] between applications
- [=Robust security=]

## <dfn>No Lock-In</dfn>

No lock-in means that users are not tied to a specific platform or ecosystem, choosing the tools that best fit their needs and being independent of any single provider. They have the freedom and autonomy to take _their data_ to alternative solutions without losing anything. Web apps should be built in such a way as to make this the _normal_ behaviour.

## <dfn>No Attention Theft</dfn>

Attention theft refers to the unethical practice of design elements or features that manipulate users' attention, leading to excessive distractions or addictive behaviors. Web apps should avoid attention theft by prioritizing user focus and minimizing unnecessary notifications or disruptive elements, allowing users to concentrate.

## <dfn>Retention Of Control</dfn>

Web apps should prioritize user control and data ownership. Users have the authority to decide how their personal data is stored, accessed, and shared. This ensures compliance with privacy regulations, empowers users to manage their information securely, and reduces the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

## <dfn>Live Collaboration</dfn>

Real-time collaboration among team members, researchers, or collaborators, facilitates seamless communication, immediate feedback, and efficient teamwork. Web apps should offer features such as real-time editing, commenting, and document sharing, ensuring that users can collaborate effectively and enhance productivity.

## <dfn>Linking Of Data</dfn>

The ability to link data between applications is crucial for seamless integration and data interoperability. Web apps should support data linking, enabling users to connect relevant fine-grained information, references, or resources across different contexts or tools. This facilitates comprehensive data analysis, knowledge discovery, and a holistic understanding of projects or research endeavors.

## <dfn>Robust Security</dfn>

Web apps should implement appropriate security measures, including data encryption, access controls, and regular security updates. This ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of users' data, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access or data loss.
