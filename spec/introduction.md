High costs of web app development have gone hand-in-hand with unwanted side effects like user lock-in, attention theft, and abdication of control over personal data. The core principle of Sustainable Web Apps, like the ideas behind it, is designed to expedite the development of healthier apps: those without dependencies on specific service providers, with user empowerment in terms of service and data portability, and with linking of data between apps – including apps developed against similar technologies sharing these principles.

Why do so many existing apps lock-in their users and their attention, and keep control over their users' personal data? We see two reasons.

First: there is an economic incentive to developing unsustainable apps. Data is valuable, and companies who produce applications would prefer to have access to as much of it as possible. Active users are valuable, as they produce valuable data, and are also available to target with another revenue source, advertising. Thus, the more an application developer can keep users and their data tied to a platform, the more that application will succeed economically—that is, until and unless the users demand an alternative. However, it's hard for users to make much progress simply asking for change; the most effective way for users to make their needs known is to actually leave the services they disagree with in favor of those which treat them better, and to do that, there must be alternatives available to move _to_.

Thus, the second reason: there is a technological disincentive to developing sustainable apps. It's simply much easier to develop an application in which everyone's data is centralized in a database under the application developer's control. Exposing that data via some sort of API is a good deal of extra effort that can be hard to justify. Interchanging data with other applications, to the point of eliminating lock-in, is even harder to justify, as it both gives users a route to leave the application _and_ is even harder to build than simply exposing the data in some ad-hoc format.

We know there are people interested in developing sustainable apps because they currently do so, even in the face of technological difficulty. The entire Solid Project is evidence of this [[SOLID]]. We have a great deal of respect for Solid and its approach, and draw inspiration from it. However, we believe it doesn't provide enough to make a range of modern applications easy to build well: in particular, apps with real-time multi-user collaboration.

Our core principle is that web app data securely stored in **reactive, replicated Linked Data sets** can make it possible for app developers to meet today's and tomorrow's feature expectations without the high costs and limitations of today's distributed data architectures. This foundational design principle combines ideas from the semantic web (machine-readable publishable interlinked data), personal data stores (user control of user data) and local-first software (collaboration without obligatory third parties).
