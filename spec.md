# Web Zero with RDFa “Spec”

This spec describes the proposed interface for what we’ll be using as the Web Zero “engine” in our Web Zero demonstration. All of this is _extremely_ draft, in that we’re still working out just what Web Zero _is_ (and what it is not).

The demo is specified to use RDFa as part of binding data to DOM, so this spec currently incorporates that interface. Eventually, the RDFa portion may be separated, leaving behind a “core” Web Zero which does not require it.

## Prerequisites

This document is built on other existing concepts, and expects the reader to be familiar with the following:

- [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/)
- [RDFa](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/)

## Example

Consider the following HTML page:

```html
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <head>
    <title>Thoughts on RDF – Ever heard of this?</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <article>
      <h1>Ever heard of this?</h1>
      <div class="byline">
        by <span class="author-name">Samantha Antic</span>
      </div>

      <div class="article-body">
        I just heard about this new thing called "Web Zero". Seems pretty neat!
        We'll have to see how it shapes up, though.
      </div>

      <div class="bio">
        <span class="author-name">Samantha Antic</span> is a technologist who
        spends a little too much time thinking about RDF.
      </div>
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
```

This page represents a blog post by an author, "Samantha Antic". Typically, a
page like this is generated by the server on demand based on templates and data
in a database. More recently, it's become common to pre-generate the static HTML
from data and host the HTML files. In either case, data is transformed into
presentational HTML, which is then sent to the client.

Suppose Samantha decides she'd rather go by just "Sam", and wishes to change how
her name appears. In the original data, this is easy: she finds her name in the
(hopefully) one place where it appears, either in a database or in a data file
somewhere, and changes it. When the HTML is generated, this results in two lines
being different:

```diff

         spends a little too much time thinking about RDF.
```

This requires Sam to have access to the database or the source data. Could we
eliminate that requirement? Could we make the HTML itself so portable that
anyone could poke at it to create a version with her changed name? Well, we can
do that today with a text editor or the browser DevTools. But when we do that,
it's easy to produce inconsistent results: we might change her name in one
place, but not the other. This is because the render process has _denormalized_
her name by putting it in two places in the HTML, and our editor has no way to
understand how to re-normalize it.

However, by attaching some semantics to the HTML markup, we can give the editor
a clear understanding of how to do exactly that. Here's the same page, now with
additional RDFa attributes providing some semantic information:

```html
<html
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  prefix="foaf: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/
          dc: http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
>
  <head>
    <title>Thoughts on RDF – Ever heard of this?</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <article>
      <h1>Ever heard of this?</h1>
      <div class="byline" property="dc:creator">
        by <span class="author-name" property="foaf:name">Samantha Antic</span>
      </div>

      <div class="article-body">
        I just heard about this new thing called "Web Zero". Seems pretty neat!
        We'll have to see how it shapes up, though.
      </div>

      <div class="bio" property="dc:creator">
        <span class="author-name" property="foaf:name">Samantha Antic</span> is
        a technologist who spends a little too much time thinking about RDF.
      </div>
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now the machine can understand that "Samantha Antic" is the `foaf:name` of the
`dc:creator` of the document. Not only does that _value_ show up twice, the
_semantic_ shows up twice. Suppose we change one of those values now. A Web
Zero-compliant editor should change both values at the same time. They are
_bound_ to the same piece of data, and thus to one another.
